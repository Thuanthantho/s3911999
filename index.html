      <h1>TEAM PROFILE</h1>
      <section id="TEAMNAME"
        <h1>TEAM NAME</h1>
        <p>According to me, if I can have a rule that allows me to put the name for my group, I will change the name to Game Development. Because one of the primary reasons I chose this name for my group is that I want others who can share my interest in online games to join my group and cooperate with me so that we can easily learn and discuss our courses. Besides that, I also hope to discover suitable teammates who share my interests so that we may continue to study together in future semesters. Moreover, if I establish my objective early on, I will be able to simply follow it to develop our product in the future, which may lead to potential employers identifying students who have an interest in the gaming business after graduation, and therefore attracting my attention in the future</p>
        <h1>TEAM PROFILE</h1>
        <p>I can easily identify persons who can cooperate with me effectively in business and life based on the results of the personality tests for Assignment 1. To begin with, I feel most at ease when I interact with people, therefore if I had the opportunity, I would want to have a teammate that enjoys sharing and discussing the difficulties we have in class and in life. Besides that, I am an emotional person since, in some situations, I frequently rely on my emotions to decide whether or not to execute this task, which may have a bad influence on my colleagues. As a result, some individuals will be able to share their experiences with my project or remind me of certain drawbacks before I make any decisions, which will be extremely beneficial to me and my team. Moreover, it not only assists us in learning more about ourselves in order to work more effectively, but it also assists us in improving our soft skills as a group prior to working in a company.</p>

  <!-- PROJECT IDEAS -->
  <section id="PROJECTIDEAS"
    <div class="title-text">
      <h1>PROJECT IDEAS</h1>
      <section id="PROJECTIDEAS"
        <h1>1.Overview</h1>
        <p>My project idea, in my view, is to create an interesting online game with a great storyline and graphics that is created by a Vietnamese individual. This game is based on my thoughts on the outside world, since if I want to attract gamers' attention, I need to produce something fresh and exciting for people to be interested in my product. Besides that, I'm going to try to incorporate some fictional storylines into this game so that players have more alternatives when playing it, such as following the storyline or relaxing by traveling about the world to sightseeing.</p>
        <h1>2.Motivation</h1>
        <p>According to Vietnamese statistics, more than half of the Vietnamese population plays online games on computers, smartphones, and consoles. As a result, the gaming sector is one of Vietnam's fastest-growing industries in the future. People, on the other hand, mostly play popular games in the world like League of Legends and Dota2, and they seldom play Vietnamese games. One of the main reasons is that Vietnam only has a few basic games, such as puzzles, and there are some small studios that want to make a good game without investing too much. Therefore, I really want to make a game that is made by a Vietnamese person, has a good storyline, and beautiful graphics, so that Vietnam may have a well-known game on the international market. </p>
        <h1>3.Description</h1>
        <p>When a company wants to make a new game, they must divide its employees into a number of groups in order to efficiently manage the game's development stage and cut down on time. Because of this, if I or a group of people want to accomplish this efficiently with only a few individuals, we will need to make a detailed plan on key aspects of online games, which will take a lot of time and require a lot of expertise from the creators. Therefore, we can rely on this to grow this game by following the stages outlined in the plan in order to provide a comprehensive and engaging experience for gamers not only in Vietnam but across the world.

	Storyline is the most important thing when it comes to game software development, therefore I will spend a lot of time thinking about how to create an imaginative tale with some fascinating characters. As a consequence, there will be a wide range of people and storylines in this game. Besides that, I will include several cultures from across the world in my game so that players may feel more comfortable while enjoying their own culture. Furthermore, the setting of my game is a mix of prehistoric, futuristic, and post-apocalyptic literature, thus, while not unique, I believe my storylines will keep players interested while playing. Besides that, I have played so many online games in the past, and I have got a lot of stories to tell about it. However, some individuals cannot imagine what I am talking about, therefore allowing them to experience them in my world is the best option.

	Audio and graphics are the most important aspects in which I must devote my time in order to produce video and alter audio appropriately in each scene. Because nowadays, people frequently watch streamers or reviews to decide whether to buy or not buy games, if this game has poor graphic quality and cannot attract players' attention, they will not want to play it, even if it has a compelling story. Besides that, audio is also significant since it has a significant influence on the players' emotions as they perform each emotive and particular scene. As a result, it will assist users in feeling like they are characters in the game, allowing them to not only have the same emotions as the characters in these situations, but also to learn certain moral lessons that they may use in the real world.

	Languages are the important features in some games if studios want to bring their games to players as much as possible in the world. In my game, I will try to add two languages such as Vietnamese and English so more people can easily approach my product. However, if I do it alone, it is really difficult for me because the quantity of labor required is dependent on the length of the character's speech. As a result, if I have a large number of characters, translating between two languages takes too long. </p>
        <h1>4.Tools and Technologies</h1>
        <p>Unreal Engine is a popular game-making program that can be found on the Internet. This software, in my opinion, makes it simple for me to begin learning how to create online games without having to learn a lot of code. Moreover, another advantage is that I can interact on the interface while testing in my game. Besides that,I also utilize an open source tool like Godot Engine to save time and change my surroundings, such as my thinking. Furthermore, I can study some open sources to learn something new that I may use in the future to pay attention to the players in my game. </p>
        <h1>5.Skill required</h1>
        <p>Coding is, in my opinion, the most significant skill, not only in gaming development but also in IT, because it is so vital when I work in this field. Aside from that, analytics abilities are critical since I frequently deal with issues when confronted with unexpected situations. Moreover, if I decide to develop a game with Unreal Engine, I'll need to have a good understanding of the program and be able to handle difficulties quickly. Furthermore, I need to learn new programming languages so that I can keep up with global technological advancements and perform a better job in my desired profession.</p>
        <h1>6.Outcome</h1>
        <p>If the project succeeds, I will be able to locate a career that suits my interests and talents. Aside from that, I'll attempt to update some new versions of my game in the future to make it more comprehensive. However, I must consider the cost of my items since if a growing number of people desire to play, I will be able to profit from this and reward myself. The security system, on the other hand, has to be improved because hackers can get access to my system and take this information. In a good sense, I can contribute to the globalization of the Vietnamese gaming industry by demonstrating that Vietnamese people are capable of producing high-quality games at a reasonable price.</p>

      <h1>FEEDBACK</h1>
      <section id="FEEDBACK"
        <h1>After I discussed my project idea with my friends, they have given me some two feedbacks so I can know the pros and cons of this in order to improve in the future.</h1>
        <h1>•	Feedback 1</h1>
        <p>“There are a range of fascinating kinds of online games in the world, so if you want to gain attention from players, it is so hard advertising the game in a non-well-known country in the gaming industry,” says the first piece of feedback I receive. Firstly, it is so helpful because it reminds me that if I want to be successful on my way, I must try to create a unique and wonderful product in the market. Besides that, I need to consider advertising effectively because many studios spend a lot of money advertising on social medias so this is a huge problem for me. Moreover, because there are a lot of games in the world, I can collect some ideas from some previous successful games to modify in different ways in order to create a unique game but it is so friendly with players. </p>
        <h1>•	Feedback 2</h1>
        <p>“If you keep working hard, you can achieve your goals, but you must invest your time and money in order to do so, since if you do not pay money for software or marketing, it is extremely difficult to be successful,” various feedback I receive says. This is extremely helpful because even if I have the expertise, I don't have enough tools to achieve this, and it's a difficult problem to solve. Therefore, if I am able to save up enough money, I will get genuine software to assist me in my work. Aside from that, I will ask my friends, coworkers, and family to promote my products so that more people take notice of them.</p>
