        <h6>According to me, if I can have a rule that allows me to put the name for my group, I will change the name to Game Development. Because one of the primary reasons I chose this name for my group is that I want others who can share my interest in online games to join my group and cooperate with me so that we can easily learn and discuss our courses. Besides that, I also hope to discover suitable teammates who share my interests so that we may continue to study together in future semesters. Moreover, if I establish my objective early on, I will be able to simply follow it to develop our product in the future, which may lead to potential employers identifying students who have an interest in the gaming business after graduation, and therefore attracting my attention in the future</h6>
