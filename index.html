      <h1>TEAM PROFILE</h1>
      <section id="TEAMNAME"
        <h1>TEAM NAME</h1>
        <p>According to me, if I can have a rule that allows me to put the name for my group, I will change the name to Game Development. Because one of the primary reasons I chose this name for my group is that I want others who can share my interest in online games to join my group and cooperate with me so that we can easily learn and discuss our courses. Besides that, I also hope to discover suitable teammates who share my interests so that we may continue to study together in future semesters. Moreover, if I establish my objective early on, I will be able to simply follow it to develop our product in the future, which may lead to potential employers identifying students who have an interest in the gaming business after graduation, and therefore attracting my attention in the future</p>
        <h1>TEAM PROFILE</h1>
        <p>I can easily identify persons who can cooperate with me effectively in business and life based on the results of the personality tests for Assignment 1. To begin with, I feel most at ease when I interact with people, therefore if I had the opportunity, I would want to have a teammate that enjoys sharing and discussing the difficulties we have in class and in life. Besides that, I am an emotional person since, in some situations, I frequently rely on my emotions to decide whether or not to execute this task, which may have a bad influence on my colleagues. As a result, some individuals will be able to share their experiences with my project or remind me of certain drawbacks before I make any decisions, which will be extremely beneficial to me and my team. Moreover, it not only assists us in learning more about ourselves in order to work more effectively, but it also assists us in improving our soft skills as a group prior to working in a company.</p>

  <!-- PROJECT IDEAS -->
  <section id="PROJECTIDEAS"
    <div class="title-text">
      <h1>PROJECT IDEAS</h1>
      <section id="PROJECTIDEAS"
        <h1>1.Overview</h1>
        <p>My project idea, in my view, is to create an interesting online game with a great storyline and graphics that is created by a Vietnamese individual. This game is based on my thoughts on the outside world, since if I want to attract gamers' attention, I need to produce something fresh and exciting for people to be interested in my product. Besides that, I'm going to try to incorporate some fictional storylines into this game so that players have more alternatives when playing it, such as following the storyline or relaxing by traveling about the world to sightseeing.</p>
        <h1>2.Motivation</h1>
        <p>According to Vietnamese statistics, more than half of the Vietnamese population plays online games on computers, smartphones, and consoles. As a result, the gaming sector is one of Vietnam's fastest-growing industries in the future. People, on the other hand, mostly play popular games in the world like League of Legends and Dota2, and they seldom play Vietnamese games. One of the main reasons is that Vietnam only has a few basic games, such as puzzles, and there are some small studios that want to make a good game without investing too much. Therefore, I really want to make a game that is made by a Vietnamese person, has a good storyline, and beautiful graphics, so that Vietnam may have a well-known game on the international market. </p>
        <h1>3.Description</h1>
        <p>When a company wants to make a new game, they must divide its employees into a number of groups in order to efficiently manage the game's development stage and cut down on time. Because of this, if I or a group of people want to accomplish this efficiently with only a few individuals, we will need to make a detailed plan on key aspects of online games, which will take a lot of time and require a lot of expertise from the creators. Therefore, we can rely on this to grow this game by following the stages outlined in the plan in order to provide a comprehensive and engaging experience for gamers not only in Vietnam but across the world.

	Storyline is the most important thing when it comes to game software development, therefore I will spend a lot of time thinking about how to create an imaginative tale with some fascinating characters. As a consequence, there will be a wide range of people and storylines in this game. Besides that, I will include several cultures from across the world in my game so that players may feel more comfortable while enjoying their own culture. Furthermore, the setting of my game is a mix of prehistoric, futuristic, and post-apocalyptic literature, thus, while not unique, I believe my storylines will keep players interested while playing. Besides that, I have played so many online games in the past, and I have got a lot of stories to tell about it. However, some individuals cannot imagine what I am talking about, therefore allowing them to experience them in my world is the best option.

	Audio and graphics are the most important aspects in which I must devote my time in order to produce video and alter audio appropriately in each scene. Because nowadays, people frequently watch streamers or reviews to decide whether to buy or not buy games, if this game has poor graphic quality and cannot attract players' attention, they will not want to play it, even if it has a compelling story. Besides that, audio is also significant since it has a significant influence on the players' emotions as they perform each emotive and particular scene. As a result, it will assist users in feeling like they are characters in the game, allowing them to not only have the same emotions as the characters in these situations, but also to learn certain moral lessons that they may use in the real world.

	Languages are the important features in some games if studios want to bring their games to players as much as possible in the world. In my game, I will try to add two languages such as Vietnamese and English so more people can easily approach my product. However, if I do it alone, it is really difficult for me because the quantity of labor required is dependent on the length of the character's speech. As a result, if I have a large number of characters, translating between two languages takes too long. </p>
        <h1>4.Tools and Technologies</h1>
        <p>Unreal Engine is a popular game-making program that can be found on the Internet. This software, in my opinion, makes it simple for me to begin learning how to create online games without having to learn a lot of code. Moreover, another advantage is that I can interact on the interface while testing in my game. Besides that,I also utilize an open source tool like Godot Engine to save time and change my surroundings, such as my thinking. Furthermore, I can study some open sources to learn something new that I may use in the future to pay attention to the players in my game. </p>
        <h1>5.Skill required</h1>
        <p>Coding is, in my opinion, the most significant skill, not only in gaming development but also in IT, because it is so vital when I work in this field. Aside from that, analytics abilities are critical since I frequently deal with issues when confronted with unexpected situations. Moreover, if I decide to develop a game with Unreal Engine, I'll need to have a good understanding of the program and be able to handle difficulties quickly. Furthermore, I need to learn new programming languages so that I can keep up with global technological advancements and perform a better job in my desired profession.</p>
        <h1>6.Outcome</h1>
        <p>If the project succeeds, I will be able to locate a career that suits my interests and talents. Aside from that, I'll attempt to update some new versions of my game in the future to make it more comprehensive. However, I must consider the cost of my items since if a growing number of people desire to play, I will be able to profit from this and reward myself. The security system, on the other hand, has to be improved because hackers can get access to my system and take this information. In a good sense, I can contribute to the globalization of the Vietnamese gaming industry by demonstrating that Vietnamese people are capable of producing high-quality games at a reasonable price.</p>

      <h1>FEEDBACK</h1>
      <section id="FEEDBACK"
        <h1>After I discussed my project idea with my friends, they have given me some two feedbacks so I can know the pros and cons of this in order to improve in the future.</h1>
        <h2>•	Feedback 1</h2>
        <p>“There are a range of fascinating kinds of online games in the world, so if you want to gain attention from players, it is so hard advertising the game in a non-well-known country in the gaming industry,” says the first piece of feedback I receive. Firstly, it is so helpful because it reminds me that if I want to be successful on my way, I must try to create a unique and wonderful product in the market. Besides that, I need to consider advertising effectively because many studios spend a lot of money advertising on social medias so this is a huge problem for me. Moreover, because there are a lot of games in the world, I can collect some ideas from some previous successful games to modify in different ways in order to create a unique game but it is so friendly with players. </p>
        <h2>•	Feedback 2</h2>
        <p>“If you keep working hard, you can achieve your goals, but you must invest your time and money in order to do so, since if you do not pay money for software or marketing, it is extremely difficult to be successful,” various feedback I receive says. This is extremely helpful because even if I have the expertise, I don't have enough tools to achieve this, and it's a difficult problem to solve. Therefore, if I am able to save up enough money, I will get genuine software to assist me in my work. Aside from that, I will ask my friends, coworkers, and family to promote my products so that more people take notice of them.</p>

      <h1>IT TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
      <section id="ITTECHNOLOGIES"
        <h1>•	Cloud Computing</h1>
        <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/bf8ufnc4see/20190826091807807-1568014246654624298664-1568014407308429996666_bcBuWF0l1.png?updatedAt=1629868643135" border="0" width="400" />
        <h2>1.	What does it do?</h2>
        <p>According to my understanding, cloud computing is a tool which is built based on a computer system and the Internet to create online storage for the users. Besides that, the main function of this cloud computing is helping users to store data easily with electrical devices basically and efficiently. In the past, when people wanted to store data in order to use it the next time in different devices, they had to use an equipment with the name Universal Serial Bus(USB)- the device allows users to store data in this. However, if you work in a company or you have to go to more places for working, USB has limited data storage so it is so difficult to store their data while working with a small USB that they can’t forget before going away from their home.
	Therefore, cloud computing is the useful solution for this. For example, nowadays, users just need two things like smartphones and wifi connection so they can use some free apps on the Internet to store anything they want instead of using USB. Moreover, cloud computing allows users to store a large amount of data without limitation. For instance, Google has an app, this is Google Cloud Storage, users just need a Google account so they can store their data to 25GB for free. However, if they want to break limitations and be free to use, they have to pay a few dollars every month to use this freely and use some other function on this service.
	However, cloud storage was created in the early stages with the appearance of computers in the past. On the other hand, the cost of paying for electrical devices related to cloud storage was too expensive at this time. Because at this time, people don’t have more solutions to create electric components with the suitable price. Therefore, although it was created so early, people can not develop cloud storage which is so expensive with business. Nowadays, we can store a large amount of data on the Internet but they also need big devices to run this system. However, businesses will organize their machines to run efficiently and users don’t need to consider this problem like in the past. Therefore, if we can in the future, increasing data storage in each device and decreasing the cost of necessary equipment, it is so helpful for businesses to run and for users to afford.
	Finally, the development of Dynamic computing resources is one of the useful support that can help the cloud computing develop rapidly. For example, instead of businesses having to calculate whether to expand or not, how many servers to invest in, now businesses only need to ask "Hey, cloud, we need more resources equivalent to 128GB of RAM” and cloud will search for free resources to provide you immediately. Therefore, it not only helps the duration of analyzing and calculating decrease quickly but it also reduces the cost of running some electrical devices. </p>
        </h2>2.	What is the likely impact?</h2>
        </p>After I researched information about the development of cloud computing on the Internet, one of the huge impacts of this development is helping users easier when storing and exchanging data between people in some different aspects. On the other hand, everything has pros and cons so cloud computing is not an exception. For example, although it makes the cost and the duration of time decrease, if development of machines rises rapidly, the opportunity of finding jobs related to cloud computing will decrease in the future.
	Based on my understanding, I will provide an example to explain my thoughts on the influence of cloud computing growth. In the past, every company always needed a few IT professionals at least to manage the system and run this effectively. But nowadays, they just need some people who have knowledge about the IT system to do this instead of paying too much money to hire a lot of employees. Because of this, if cloud computing continues to develop at its current rate, every business may only require an employer who can fix system errors and maintain system stability, and no one will need to spend a lot of money on IT professionals to do so because they can use advanced technology such as robots or Artificial Intelligence(AI) to do so effectively. Therefore, in my opinion, if cloud computing grows fast in parallel with the development of robots and AI, some of the IT professions listed above may become outdated, or people may lose interest in working in this field in the future.</p>
        <h2>3.	How will this affect me?</h2>
        <p>Cloud computing is a crucial part of my everyday life, since it helps me learn and work in a variety of settings. For example, when I study at university, I have to receive the materials from the lecturer and exchange data to do assignments quickly and efficiently. So if I do not have suitable technology for storing information, I will forget this and it is so difficult for me to remember something without writing on paper. Moreover, especially when I study online, if RMIT doesn't have any apps such as Microsoft Teams or Canvas to store materials, it is so difficult for me and my teammates to study and research. Moreover, in my program, I have to code to create a product so if I don’t have a tool to do this easily, it is a serious problem for me to think of useful solutions.
In my opinion, it has the same effects with my family and my friends in many aspects. Besides that, because my friends have to go to university to study, they will need this more than my parents. On the other hand, my parents often use it for their demands. For example, my mother often saves some posts about cooking on Facebook and some videos about doing exercise on Youtube to rewatch in the next time. Therefore, cloud computing plays an important role in everyone’s daily life, especially in working and entertainment.</p>
        <h1>•	Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h1>
        <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/bf8ufnc4see/download__1__aw66OUJK4.jpg?updatedAt=1629868681309" border="0" width="400" />
        <h2>1.	What does it do?</h2>
        <p>According to my understanding, electronic money, often known as digital currency, is a form of currency that is kept on the Internet, computer systems, cellphones, and electronic payment cards and is based on electronic algorithms. Besides that, the main function of them is used for replacing money in the real world in order to digital money on the Internet. Moreover, everyone can trade products and services by using cryptocurrencies on the Internet. In addition, Blockchain is a bitcoin blockchain discovery service that also contains a cryptocurrency wallet and an exchange. Therefore, the combination between blockchain and cryptocurrencies lead to the appearance of a new kind of currency that everyone can own and trade easily on the Internet instead of exchanging money in the real world.
In my opinion, blockchain and cryptocurrencies that will develop quickly in the fourth industrial, may become common currency to trade with other people in the future effectively and safely. Moreover, nowadays, there are more and more free websites which can help people create digital wallets quickly so they can buy and sell cryptocurrencies rapidly by utilizing their banking account. In addition, there are so many cryptocurrencies in the world such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. They are a common and famous digital currency in the world so the cost of them is very expensive. For instance, until today and based on the statistics of international banking, 1 $Bitcoin costs about 50000 USD and 1 $Ethereum costs 3131.47 USD. Therefore, we can easily identify the development of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Although we can’t touch or see them like money in the real world, they are more expensive than this too many times. On the other hand, nowadays, some people have used digital currencies to transfer money to use but it is also difficult if everyone have to use it like USD in the real world because some people don’t believe and have enough knowledge about that so a lot of people won’t use it to pay for cost of their everyday living. Furthermore, more and more younger generations have more understanding about blockchain and cryptocurrencies like a subject in school or a hot topic that everyone can discuss. Therefore, this digital currency may become one of the common money that everybody can own and trade in the society easily.
Besides that, the development of some services or businesses which own the digital currency can help blockchain and cryptocurrencies develop at the same time. Nowadays, more and more companies in the world evaluate the cost of their businesses based on the cost of their digital currencies. Because this currency just changes based on the development of this business in many aspects. For example, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) is the famous and professional football team in the League 1 - the premier football league in France. When they signed the contract with Leonel Messi - one of the best famous football players in the world, their digital currency with the name- PSG inscribed quickly and became very expensive at this time. Because of this, it results in the cost of PSG organization and other business which are owned by the boss of PSG develop rapidly. Therefore, the development of something related using digital currency to evaluate or trade will affect the development of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the future.</p>
        <h2>2.	What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <p>With the development of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, one of the huge impacts that we can easily know is the bitcoin mining. Some individuals utilize high-tech graphic cards to earn digital money in many nations across the world since they consume less power and the results can be better than 50 to 100 times instead of paying a lot of money for energy, but the benefits are just minor. As a result, there is a shortage of graphic cards in the globe since many individuals are willing to spend a lot of money to acquire these graphic cards in order to mine Bitcoin successfully. It not only raises the price of these graphics cards, but it also makes them harder to get for other purposes such as pleasure or employment.
In my opinion, although the development of digital currency plays an important role in the industrial 4.0, it also has some effects with some people. Like an example above, although there are a lot of ways to mine Bitcoin, using graphic cas to mine is the common way that a lot of people do. Therefore, it makes the price of some electrical devices increase because of the lack of necessary equipment. Especially, some people just need them for working and studying but they don’t have enough money to buy graphics with the cost like this.
According to me, in the future, if the development rate keeps increasing like this, some jobs related to manufacturing and trading may appear. Therefore, it may create some new jobs for younger generations in the future.
</p>
        <h2>3) How will this affect you?</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, it has a huge impact on me because my future job will relate to IT so I ensure that I will do some tasks related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the future. One year ago, I played one game with the name Axie Infinity - this game is built on blockchain technology. In this game, we can earn money in this game by finishing some tasks in the game everyday and then we can use this money like digital money to trade for earning money in the real world. Besides that, there are a lot of games like that in the world but it may relate to some other features such as sport, cards, news, etc. Therefore, in my opinion, they may be similar to one kind of business model in which players have to pay money which depends on the user's demands to earn little or more money to invest, and then they can use their digital money to trade with another one.
However, everything has pros and cons so blockchain and cryptocurrencies are not an exception. Some people lie to users who don't have enough knowledge about the digital currency and how to run it, to invest for digital money by money in the real world to steal money. Because in some situations, some people need a lot of money immediately or teenagers want to earn money without their parents so it results they can easily be lied to by strangers on the Internet. Besides that, I not only listen to too many stories from my friends who deal with this problem but I also see some scam sites such as Wefinet that are listed on the VTV- Vietnamese national TV channel. </p>
